# .NET MAUI - Workshop

Today we will build a [.NET MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont) application that will display a list of Monkeys from around the world. We will start by building the business logic backend that pulls down json-ecoded data from a RESTful endpoint. We will then leverage [.NET MAUI Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/index?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont) to find the closest monkey to us and also show the monkey on a map. We will also see how to display data in many different ways and then finally fully theme the application.


## Setup Guide
Hey there! This workshop will be a hands on and a bring your own device workshop. You can develop on PC (Recommended) or Mac and all you will need to do is install Visual Studio  2022 or Visual Studio for Mac 2022 with the .NET MAUI workload.

Follow our simple [setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont) to ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 and .NET MAUI setup and ready to deploy.

Before the conference I recommend going through the quick 10 minute [.NET MAUI Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont) that will guide you through installation and also ensuring everything is configured correct.

If you are new to mobile development, we recommend deploying to a physical Android device which can be setup in just a few steps. If you don't have a device, don't worry as you can setup an [Android emulator with hardware acceleration](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont). If you don't have time to set this up ahead of time, don't worry as we are here to help during the workshop.

Beyond that you will be good to go for the workshop!


## Agenda

I have also put together an abstract of what you can expect for the day long workshop:

* 30 Min Session - Introduction to .NET MAUI Session & Setup Help
* Single Page List of Data
* MVVM & Data Binding
* Navigation
* Implementing Native Features
* The many ways to display data
* Theming the app


To get started open the `Part 1 - Displaying Data` folder and open `MonkeyFinder.sln`. You can use this throughout the workshop. Each **part** has a **README** file with directions for that part. If you came in late, you can open any of the folders and  there is a starting project for that section.
